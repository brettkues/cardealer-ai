Please screenshot or copy/paste the full folder tree view from GitHub:

- every folder in root
- every folder inside /app
- every folder inside /lib
- every folder inside /public
- every folder inside /api if applicable

If GitHub hides nested levels, manually expand and list them exactly like this:

root/
  app/
    admin/
    auth/
    dashboard/
    image-generator/
    api/
      buildImage/
      lookupVehicle/
  lib/
    firebaseClient.js
  public/
  node_modules/   (should NOT be here — if it is, that’s the problem)
  .next/          (should NOT be in GitHub — if it is, that’s the problem)
  package.json
  next.config.js
